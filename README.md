# iRobotGUI

**Mission Science iRobots**

Author: USC CSCI-577 Team07 in Spring 2015

The USC Viterbi School of Engineering Pre-College Programs offers an exciting program for community children and their families, including hands-on science and technology activities, projects, experiments, and demonstrations after school in various Los Angeles communities.

In this project, our team aims to help elementary school students experience programming languages using iRobot. To achieve this goal, **we designed a drag and drop GUI so that undergraduate students can be trained to teach elementary school students to program iRobots with different functions and sensors and understand logic and control systems.**
